Hello!

/*	Description
================================= */

App it Up! is a WP plugin that will save any Wordpress website into a user's iPhone or iPad, and will make the website feel and look like an app. All the user has to do is add the site to the device's Home Screen. 
From the plugin settings page, you're able to name your app, upload an icon to be displayed in the user's device, upload a startup image that will be used as the splash-image while the app loads when the user opens it, and you can select whether to use jQuery or plain old Javascript to create the "App like" experience. The plugin uses Apple's iOS Developer Library guidelines for it's functionality.

1) Simply install the plugin into Wordpress and activate it.

2) Once the plugin has been activated, you should see it show up in the left menu of your dashboard towards the bottom. Click on it to open the settings page where you will be able to setup your app.

3) Once you name your app, and upload it's icons and startup images, you're done! Your site is now a iPhone or iPad app!
